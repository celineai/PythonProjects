# PythonProjects
All the Python projects I have worked on. These are usually for specifically tutorials, for instance, Programming with Mosh.

Honestly? Reteaching myself Python was a humbling experience, but it felt nice to work on projects again no matter how small. Coding does feel like a competitive thing, but it is a skill I am grateful to have learn. 

My future plans are to organize this into skill levels. For instance, some of these projects are definitely not on the same skill level, but they did help me along the way, and I'd like to showcase them somewhere.
